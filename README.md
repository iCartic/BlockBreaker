# BlockBreaker
A fork of the [BlockBreaker](https://github.com/heyx3/BlockBreaker) project. This fork provides a full Skillz integration, including both normal and turn-based tournaments as well as the "skillz_difficulty" param that is passed in to make the game harder for more experienced players.

A simple Unity game designed for iOS. The player(s) clear groups of identical blocks; bigger groups give exponentially more points.

## Game Modes
There are two game modes:

* Timed
    * One player tries to get as high a score as possible in the allotted time
* Turn-based
    * Two players take turns clearing blocks. The player with the highest score after a certain number of turns is the winner.

## Code
### Game Grid
The blocks are organized on a rectangular grid of a fixed size. Grid-related scripts are stored in "Assets/Scripts/Game Grid Stuff".

The grid representation is stored in the "GameGrid" MonoBehaviour script; it holds a 2D array of integers (representing the different types of blocks) and provides methods for modifying the grid.

The block objects each have a "GameGridBlock" MonoBehaviour component, which constantly seeks toward its position in the grid. The blocks are given animation by simply moving them away from their grid position, making them move back towards it again (this is most easily accomplished through the use of the "PushBlockAway" Monobehaviour script).

The blocks are generated by the "GameGridGenerator" MonoBehaviour script on its "Start()" method.

### Player Input
Player input is handled by the script "Assets/Scripts/PlayerInput.cs". It waits for a finger tap (or mouse click if testing in the editor) and checks whether the tap was on a block, in which case it clears the block and any blocks that touch it.

### Gameplay Flow
All game flow scipts are in "Assets/Scripts/Gameplay Controllers". "GameplayController.cs" is an abstract MonoBehaviour class that represents some game mode. There are two classes that inherit from it: "GameplayController_Timed" and "GameplayController_TurnBased".

Both of these game modes have their own gameplay scene, as well as an accompanying "Review" scene that shows the scores once the game is over.

### UI
All UI scripts are in "Assets/Scripts/UI". They use the old UI system for Unity (using the "GUI" class).

## Skillz Integration

Integrating Skillz with the timed game-type was easy -- just put in a game scene before the main menu that initializes the Skillz SDK, and add some hooks for the "GameplayController_Timed" script that report the score to Skillz if in a Skillz tournament.

Integrating Skillz with the turn-based game-type is a bit more involved, because the game state has to be serialized and sent to the Skillz server so that the other player can read it in, deserialize it, and start the game from there. This was accomplished in the following way:

1. Create a "TurnBasedGameData" data structure that holds all the stuff needed for a turn-based game (game grid, number of turns left, player scores, etc) and give it the ability to serialize/deserialize the data to/from a string.

2. In the GameplayController_TurnBased script, if in a Skillz tournament, then load the data from the "TurnBasedGameData" struct and start the game from there instead of generating a new game. Along with this, the GameGridGenerator script is changed so that it must be manually told to generate the level, instead of automatically doing it on "Start()". Finally, after a player takes his turn, the script has to submit the results of the turn to Skillz and end the scene instead of just moving to the next turn.

3. Add a new game-type, GameplayController_Review (and a corresponding game scene), that just shows the current state of a turn-based game so that the player can review the current state of his turn-based tournament as he waits for his opponent to take their turn.
